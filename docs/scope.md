# Video player scope

This document describes a video-player proof of concept. The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate skills of implementing a video player using one of the existing JavaScript frameworks both for client and server side.

Here's the scope of the player:
 - As a user, I want to see a list of available clips
 - As a user, I want to play selected clip
 - As a user, I want to fast-forward the video and do the reverse activity
 - As a user, I want to stop playback
 - As a user, I want to change resolution of the video playback
 - As a user, I want to switch between hls and native implementation
